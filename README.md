## Integration Guide

<!-- #ZEROPS_EXTRACT_START:integration-guide# -->

### 1. Adding `zerops.yaml`

The main configuration file — place at repository root. It tells Zerops how to build, deploy and run your app.

```yaml
zerops:
  # Production — optimized build, compiled assets, framework caches,
  # full service connectivity (DB, Redis, S3, Meilisearch).
  - setup: prod
    build:
      # Multi-base build: PHP for Composer, Node for Vite asset
      # compilation. Both runtimes are fully available on PATH
      # during the build — no manual install needed.
      base:
        - php@8.4
        - nodejs@22
      buildCommands:
        # Production Composer install — no dev packages, classmap
        # optimized for faster autoloading in production.
        - composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
        # Vite compiles Tailwind CSS and JS into content-hashed
        # bundles in public/build/. These static assets are all
        # the runtime container needs from the Node side.
        - npm install
        - npm run build
      deployFiles:
        # List each directory explicitly — deploying ./ would
        # ship node_modules, .env.example, and other build-only
        # artifacts the runtime container doesn't need.
        - app
        - bootstrap
        - config
        - database
        - public
        - resources/views
        - routes
        - storage
        - vendor
        - artisan
        - composer.json
      # Cache vendor/ and node_modules/ between builds so
      # Composer and npm skip redundant network fetches.
      cache:
        - vendor
        - node_modules

    # Readiness check gates the traffic switch — new containers
    # must answer HTTP 200 before the L7 balancer routes to them.
    # This enables zero-downtime deploys.
    deploy:
      readinessCheck:
        httpGet:
          port: 80
          path: /health

    run:
      # php-nginx serves via Nginx + PHP-FPM — no explicit start
      # command needed; the base image handles both processes.
      base: php-nginx@8.4
      # Nginx serves static files from public/ and proxies PHP
      # requests to FPM. Laravel expects this as its web root.
      documentRoot: public
      # Config, route, and view caches MUST be built at runtime.
      # Build runs at /build/source/ but the app serves from
      # /var/www/ — caching during build bakes wrong paths.
      #
      # Migrations run exactly once per deploy via zsc execOnce,
      # regardless of how many containers start in parallel.
      # Seeder populates sample data on first deploy so the
      # dashboard shows real records immediately.
      # Scout import rebuilds the Meilisearch index from DB data
      # after seeding — the safety net for when auto-indexing
      # fires zero events (records already exist from prior deploy).

      # 5-minute retry window expires — keeps production alive.

### 2. Trust the reverse proxy

Zerops terminates SSL at its L7 balancer and forwards requests via reverse proxy. Without trusting the proxy, Laravel rejects CSRF tokens and generates `http://` URLs instead of `https://`. In `bootstrap/app.php`:

```php
->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware): void {
    $middleware->trustProxies(at: '*');
})
```

### 3. Configure Redis client

Laravel defaults to the `phpredis` C extension. On Zerops, the `predis` pure-PHP client avoids needing a compiled extension. Install via Composer and set `REDIS_CLIENT=predis` in your environment:

```bash
composer require predis/predis
```

### 4. Configure S3 object storage

Install the S3 Flysystem adapter and set `FILESYSTEM_DISK=s3` with the Zerops object storage credentials. Path-style endpoints are mandatory for the MinIO-backed storage:

```bash
composer require league/flysystem-aws-s3-v3
```

### 5. Configure Meilisearch search

Install Laravel Scout with the Meilisearch driver for full-text search. Add the `Searchable` trait to models you want indexed:

```bash
composer require laravel/scout meilisearch/meilisearch-php
```

### Gotchas

- **No `.env` file** — Zerops injects environment variables as OS env vars. Creating a `.env` file with empty values shadows the OS vars, causing `env()` to return `null` for every key that appears in `.env` even if the platform has a value set.
- **Cache commands in `initCommands`, not `buildCommands`** — `config:cache`, `route:cache`, and `view:cache` bake absolute paths into their cached files. The build container runs at `/build/source/` while the runtime serves from `/var/www/`. Caching during build produces paths like `/build/source/storage/...` that crash at runtime with "directory not found."
- **`APP_KEY` is project-level** — Laravel's encryption key must be shared across all services that read the same database (app + worker both need the same key for sessions and encrypted columns). Set it once at project level in Zerops; do not add it per-service or in `zerops.yaml envVariables`.
- **PDO PostgreSQL extension** — The `php-nginx` base image includes `pdo_pgsql` out of the box. No `prepareCommands` or `apk add` needed for PostgreSQL connectivity.
- **Predis over phpredis** — The `php-nginx` base image does not include the `phpredis` C extension. Use the `predis/predis` Composer package and set `REDIS_CLIENT=predis` to avoid "class Redis not found" errors.
- **Object storage requires path-style** — Zerops object storage uses MinIO, which requires `AWS_USE_PATH_STYLE_ENDPOINT=true`. Without it, the SDK attempts virtual-hosted bucket URLs that MinIO cannot resolve.
- **Vite manifest missing on dev after fresh deploy** — the `dev` setup intentionally omits `npm run build` from `buildCommands` so the HMR workflow (`npm run dev` via SSH) stays fast. Any view rendering `@vite(...)` therefore 500s with `Vite manifest not found at: /var/www/public/build/manifest.json` on the first request after a `zerops_deploy`. Fix: run `ssh appdev 'cd /var/www && npm run build'` once after the deploy and before `zerops_verify` — SSHFS propagates the manifest into the container without a redeploy. For iterative work, `ssh appdev 'cd /var/www && nohup npm run dev > /tmp/vite.log 2>&1 &'` drops `public/build/hot` and Laravel routes asset URLs to the dev server. **Do NOT add `npm run build` to dev `buildCommands`** — it adds ~20–30 s to every `zcli push` and defeats the HMR-first design.
